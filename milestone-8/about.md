## About Page

### Introduction
OKCupid is a popular dating app with over 50 million users, 10 million of which use the app daily. A staggering 1.6 billion swipes occur daily and around 1.5 million OKCupid dates occur per week. Originally launched on college campuses, OkCupid is a popular medium for dating interactions for Harvard students. As a user myself, it seems that there are many insights to gain from approaching OKCupid using a data science lenses.

### Data
I downloaded this data from an open github dataset available here: https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid. This dataset was published by the Journal of Statistics Education in 2015. The dataset provides user-level profiles of approximately 60,000 users of the dating app OkCupid. I downloaded the raw csv file, moved it into the project directory, and loaded it into R. Because the data is so extensive, I have not included a glimpse() or head() of the data.

To be honest, I was hoping to collect more "primary" data by downloading my tinder data as well as that of several other Harvard students. However, the data request takes a few days to process and I wasn't able to get my hands on it in time. OkCupid data is has 60,000 user profiles from California in 2017. OKCupid profiles include several essay questions, preferences, and demographic details. 

From this project, I'll focus on the profiles. Specifically, I'll look at what factors influence the contents of a bio and visualize patterns in common words and sentiments written in dating profile bios.
